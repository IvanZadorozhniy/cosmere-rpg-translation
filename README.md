# Aim of the repository
I use this repository for storing files that I translated for my game party in Foundry VTT for cosmere rpg system. You can find the system [here](https://github.com/the-metalworks/cosmere-rpg)

Also I translated the playtest material from the same team. It can be found [here](https://github.com/the-metalworks/cosmere-rpg-worlds)

# What exactly does it do?
There is a great module that uses Babele to translate other modules in Russian, it is the [Phantom module](https://github.com/phenomen/foundry-vtt-ru). I use it as a base for translation. It change files in runtime for users who set Russian as main language. Below, you can see the difference in one image:
