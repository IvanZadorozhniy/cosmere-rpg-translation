<div><h3>Patch 1.0.1 - August 2025</h3>
<p>The first post-release patch is here! This is a pretty small hotfix which focuses on some of our automation system bugs and various visual/styling problems across the board. We did manage to work in a new quality of life feature, though.</p>
<h2>Feature Highlight, Singular</h2>
<h3>Item Macros, At Last ⌨️</h3>
<p>We can now, finally, present to you the least exciting but still really quite useful quality of life feature: dragging items to the macro bar from a character sheet now actually creates a macro to use that item, instead of opening its sheet! Amazing. This one may have sat on the back burner for a very long time, but hey, at least it&#39;s here now.</p>
