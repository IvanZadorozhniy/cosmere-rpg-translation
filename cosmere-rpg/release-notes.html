<div><h3>Release 2.0.0 ✨</h3>
<p><sup>23rd October 2025</sup></p>
<p>V13 is finally here! While functionality-wise nothing has changed, this update was a massive undertaking under the hood. 
We&#39;ve had to overhaul significant portions of the codebase to bring them up to date and while we&#39;ve got a lot of clean up left to do, this should make future upgrades much easier.</p>
<p>Due to the changes we had to make, everything from version 2.0.0 onwards will no longer be compatible with Foundry V12.</p>
<p>With this release, all of the premium modules have also been updated for V13 so be sure to grab the latest versions if you own any of them!</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for your patience while we worked through this major update!<br>— <strong>Team Metalworks</strong></p>
